   "This indicates the heuristic most used in set of support strategies: 
	start with just the negated theorem in the SOS and keep adding in those clauses 
	which are generated from the resolution of anything with an SOS member."

	SOS Condition:
	=============
	if clause.is_negated_goal or clause.derived_from_negated_goal or clause.sos

	Set .sos property at resolution time:
	====================================
		clause1_in_sos = clause1.is_negated_goal or clause1.derived_from_negated_goal or clause1.sos
		clause2_in_sos = clause2.is_negated_goal or clause2.derived_from_negated_goal or clause2.sos
		new_clause_derived_from_negated_goal = clause1.is_negated_goal or clause2.is_negated_goal

		combined_clause = Clause(clause, 
							sos=clause1_in_sos or clause2_in_sos,
							derived_from_negated_clause=new_clause_derived_from_negated_goal,
							...)
